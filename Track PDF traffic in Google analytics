Tracking Search Traffic to the PDF

Add a URL parameter to every link pointing to each PDF document on your site.

For example: <a href=”http://www.domain.com/services/brochure.pdf?pdf=Services-Brochure” target=”_blank”>Services Brochure</a>

In the above URL we’ve added the parameter “?pdf=Services-Brochure” to the end of the PDF URL link.

Notice we added our own custom tracking text to the parameter so we could tell this link was the “Services Brochure”.

This doesn’t change the way the PDF document is displayed or downloaded by your users.
