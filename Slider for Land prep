<p>Land preparation is accomplished through tillage.</p>
<p>Tillage is the mechanical manipulation of the soil to establish a crop and enhance crop growth. The tillage operation is divided into two major activities: primary tillage and secondary tillage.</p>

<p>Primary tillage is the initial working of the soil after the crop harvest or at the beginning of the next wet season. It may be done when grasses are still growing, or when the ground is simply fallow.</p>
<p>Moldboard, “stick” or chisel, and disc plows are the common implements used for primary tillage. Plows may be tractor- or animal-drawn implements.</p>

<p>Secondary tillage is the subsequent cultivation of the soil after primary tillage. It conditions the soil to meet different tillage objectives for the seed to germinate.</p>
<p>The purposes of secondary tillage are as follows: reduce the size of soil clods, control weeds, incorporate plant materials and fertilizer into the soil, and make the field surface uniform and level.</p>
<p>An implement for secondary tillage is the harrow. Examples of the harrow are the comb-tooth and spike-tooth harrows; both are used under wet and dry land field conditions.</p>
<p>The tractor- or animal-drawn implements and the wooden plank or leveler are also secondary tillage implements.</p>
